d) Branches are used for new features so they don't affect the main branch
	Branches are also used to support parallel development

e) Git log gives all commands run on a repository, while git status shows
	whether files are being tracked or not 

f) git log Vehicle.h

g) git log --grep="file"

h) I] Inheritance is when a child class gets member data
	and functions from the parent class

   II] Polymorphism is when classes share functions
	to make the implementation of the classes easier
   
   III] Encapsulation is when a class is implemented to
	not show the user the  internal workings of the
	class, but just what they need to know

i) In the Integration Manager workflow each developer 
	pushes to a public directory and then each programmer's
	version is checked for validity and pushed to 
	the Blessed Repository. In the Dictator and Lieutenants
	workflow each developer has one repository of their own
	that gets pushed to respective branches, where it is tested
	with some of the other's code. Then all branches get merged
	into one, tested again, and finally pushed to the repository
	when everything is good. 

j) A large team benefits from the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow
	because it allows for more opportunities of code 
	verification so the Blessed Repository doesn't get
	messed up by untested commits from the developers
